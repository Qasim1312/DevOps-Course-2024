In my blog, "Clean Architecture: You Don’t Know It Until You Apply It," I shared my insights on understanding and implementing Clean Architecture in real-world projects. I explained its core principles, such as the independence of frameworks, UI, and databases, and how it helps in building scalable, maintainable, and testable systems. By breaking down the layers—Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Frameworks/Drivers—I highlighted the importance of separating concerns to focus on business logic effectively. The blog reflects my belief that Clean Architecture goes beyond theory; you truly understand its value only when you apply it to solve practical challenges in software development.
